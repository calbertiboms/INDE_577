# **Gradient Descent Algorithm**

## Overview

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in various machine learning algorithms. It iteratively adjusts the parameters of the model to find the minimum of the cost function, which corresponds to the best-fitting model to the training data.

In this project, we:

1. Implement the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch.
2. Apply it to a simple linear regression problem.
3. Visualize the cost function and the convergence of the algorithm.
4. Explore the effects of different learning rates and initialization.

## **How Gradient Descent Works**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with random initial values for the parameters (weights and bias).
2. **Compute the Cost Function**:
   - Calculate the error between the predicted values and the actual values using a cost function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression).
3. **Calculate Gradients**:
   - Compute the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
4. **Update Parameters**:
   - Adjust the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient by a factor proportional to the learning rate.
5. **Iteration**:
   - Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a set number of iterations is reached.

**Key Features**:

- **Learning Rate (\(\alpha\))**: Determines the step size in each iteration.
- **Convergence**: The algorithm aims to find the global minimum of the cost function.
- **Efficiency**: Gradient Descent is computationally efficient for large datasets.

   - Use a known engineering function to test the implementation.
3. **Visualize Convergence**:

4. **Experiment with Hyperparameters**:
   - Adjust learning rates and initial parameters to study their effects.

## **Code Workflow**

### **1. Data Preparation**

- Define a known function to analyze.
- Visualize the function to understand its structure.

### **2. Implementing Gradient Descent**

- **Initialize Parameters**:
  - Set initial weights (\(w\)) and bias (\(b\)), often starting at zero or small random values.
- **Define Cost Function**:
  - Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function:
    \[
    J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - (w x_i + b))^2
    \]
- **Compute Gradients**:
  - Calculate derivatives with respect to \(w\) and \(b\):
    \[
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i (y_i - (w x_i + b))
    \]
    \[
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - (w x_i + b))
    \]
- **Update Parameters**:
  - Adjust \(w\) and \(b\) using the learning rate (\(\alpha\)):
    \[
    w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial w}
    \]
    \[
    b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}
    \]
- **Iterate**:
  - Repeat the process for a set number of epochs or until the cost function converges.

### **3. Visualization**

- **Cost Function Over Iterations**:
  - Plot the cost \(J(w, b)\) against the number of iterations to visualize convergence.
- **Regression Line**:
  - Plot the fitted regression line over the data points at different stages of training.

### **4. Experimentation**

- **Learning Rate Effects**:
  - Test different learning rates (e.g., 0.01, 0.1, 0.001) and observe the impact on convergence.
- **Initialization Effects**:
  - Try different initial values for \(w\) and \(b\) to see how they affect the optimization path.

## **Results**

- **Convergence**:
  - The algorithm successfully minimized the cost function, converging to optimal parameter values.
- **Learning Rate Impact**:
  - **High Learning Rate**:
    - Faster initial progress but risk of overshooting the minimum.
  - **Low Learning Rate**:
    - Slower convergence but more stable and precise.
- **Final Parameters**:
  - Obtained optimal weights and bias that fit the data.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how the Gradient Descent algorithm can be implemented from scratch and used to solve a linear regression problem. By adjusting hyperparameters like the learning rate and initial parameters, we can influence the convergence behavior of the algorithm. Visualizing the cost function and regression line provides insights into the optimization process and the effectiveness of Gradient Descent.
